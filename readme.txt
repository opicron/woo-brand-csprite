The automatic image sprite generator for Woocommerce Brands

== Description ==

Go to WordPress Dashboard > Tools > CSprite > Rebuild to build the sprites for Woocommmerce Brands.

CSS sprite generator will do all the hard work of combining all the images into a single graphic.

It will create all the classes for you in the enqueued stylesheet.

You can then simply use the sprite in your theme like this 

&lt;div class=&quot;csprite csprite-creatomatic_logo&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

or with the [csprite-brands] shortcode.

It will name the classes according to the image names, so make sure that they are unique.
